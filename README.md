# React Native Navigation + MobX (w/ Provider) Boilerplate ðŸ‘½

A simple boilerplate based on MobX (w/ Provider) instead of Redux and [wix/react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).

##### What's in package.json
- `react '16.3.1'`
- `react-native '0.55.4'`
- `react-native-navigation '1.1.134'`
- `mobx ''`
- `mobx-persist ''`
- `mobx-react ''`

# Installation
1. Clone this repo: `git clone `
2. Inside the directory , update npm. `npm update` followed by `npm install`
3. Make sure yarn is installed. `npm install -g yarn` (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
2. Install node modules: `yarn`. 
3. `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` (if you have any errors while building the project for iOS, remove the `ios/build` directory or visit [facebook/react-native/issues/7308](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/7308) for more information).
